# Sh snippets

I try to write POSIX compatible shell scripts, and some snippets are
really useful, hence why this. I might create a Bash subfolder for
bash-only shell scripts one day, but I don't see the point now.

See inline comments for more details. 

### Color Codes

I have a few scripts that does it. A more thorough take would be
[ansi](https://github.com/fidian/ansi), but it's a bit much to convert
to POSIX Shell. A thorough explanation is found
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code), and all modern
terminal emulators have [this](https://vt100.net/) to blame, so there
you go.
