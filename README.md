# snippets
Useful code snippets that aren't a part of a big repo. With
comments/README. One language per folder.

## Introduction

While making dotfile/cheatsheets, I found it useful to make a snippets
repo that hosts code snippets useful in a variety of ways. Some
original, some not. Regardless, I try to place them here and record them
in case I need a quick lookup. Not meant to be exhaustive or
authoritative.
